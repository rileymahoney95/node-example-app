# Node Express TypeScript API Architecture

This document outlines the implemented architecture of a Node.js API built with Express and TypeScript. The project demonstrates a layered architecture with strong typing, validation, and documentation features.

## Core Features

- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation with Zod validation
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI/Swagger using zod-to-openapi
- **Database Support**: PostgreSQL with TypeORM and DynamoDB options
- **Security**: JWT authentication, role-based access, and Helmet.js
- **Error Handling**: Global error catching and structured responses
- **Validation**: Request validation using Zod schemas
- **Logging**: Structured logging with Winston

## Project Structure

This document describes a high-level architecture for building a Node.js API with Express and TypeScript. It outlines a layered approach—including routes, controllers, services, and models—and highlights design pattern best practices. The guidelines here use industry-standard libraries such as [Express](https://expressjs.com/) for HTTP handling and [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/) (or an equivalent ORM) for data modeling. Feel free to swap in alternatives (like Mongoose for MongoDB) as needed.

## Overview

The proposed architecture uses a **separation of concerns** design pattern to isolate responsibilities. By dividing the API into discrete layers—each with a clear role—you can achieve better modularity, scalability, and testability. The key layers include:

- **Routes:** Define endpoint mappings and HTTP method associations.
- **Controllers:** Handle incoming requests, validate input, and coordinate with the service layer.
- **Services:** Contain business logic and coordinate operations between controllers and models.
- **Models:** Represent the data structures and interact with the database through an ORM.

## Folder Structure

A sample folder structure might look like this:

```
/src
├── config           // Configuration files (e.g., database, environment)
├── controllers      // API controllers
├── middlewares      // Custom middlewares (e.g., error handling, authentication)
├── models           // Database models/ORM entities
├── routes           // Express route definitions
├── services         // Business logic services
├── utils            // Utility functions (e.g., logging)
├── app.ts           // Express app initialization
└── server.ts        // Server startup script
```

This structure promotes modularity by separating concerns into different folders.

## Additional Requirements

Please implement the following:
### Middlewares

- Error Handling: Global error catcher middleware.
- Authentication/Authorization: Token validation or role checks.
- Logging: Using libraries like Winston for structured logging.
- Note: include just basic structure for now

### Configuration

- Environment Variables: Use packages like dotenv to manage environment-specific settings.
- Centralized Config Files: Maintain configuration settings in a dedicated folder (e.g., /src/config).

### Error Handling

- Use centralized error handling middleware.
- Consider wrapping asynchronous routes with error handlers or using helper libraries like express-async-handler.

> 1. implement a postgres database layer with typeorm
> 2. implement a nosql database layer with dynamoDB
> 3. implement a basic logging layer using winston
